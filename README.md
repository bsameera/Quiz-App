# Quiz-App

The Dog's Quiz is a simple app, which is responsive in design. This means that it will work on any device including tablets and mobile phones, one design and code for all the devices. It consists of a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of CSS media queries. As the user switches from their laptop to iPad, the website will automatically switch to accommodate for resolution, image size and scripting abilities.

The main scripting language is Javascript which is very popular these days. The main logic is in the file script.js. It dictates the behaviour of the app whereas the HTML and CSS define the appearance i.e. color and size of the different structures of the app.

The quiz game gives you the correct or wrong answer after each question and also the final score at the end. To play the game, go to https://repl.it/@bsameera/QuizApp
